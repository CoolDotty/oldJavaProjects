# oldJavaProjects
My old eclipse workspace I made around 2014/2015. Includes my exploration into Java, processing, and some onlines stuff including a chatbot and some simple server packet stuff. Enjoy!

I recommend
- ChernoGame: Following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYT7Lqt1h8&list=PLlrATfBNZ98eOOCk2fOFg7Qg5yoQfFAdf) tutorial, making a game from scratch using only native Java libraries. Includes setting up everything from graphics to collision to getting resources and more. My personal favourite.
- Lotto: Small program my mom wanted to take a bunch of pervious lotto numbers and get the averages.
- NetworkChat: Server/client program for a chat made from scratch.
- TwitchBot: Chatbot that hooks into Twitch chat using an IRC library.
